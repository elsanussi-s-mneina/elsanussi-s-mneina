# Repository News
## March 2021
- March 16th: Released a new Romanization system for Arabic. Released a web application to transliterate text in it. It has been deployed to my Online Utilities page. [Try it](https://elsanussi-s-mneina.github.io/u/artranslit_hslash.html). [See repository](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/h-slash-arabic-romanization-html-js)
- March 8th: Updated Arabic virtual keyboard to support physical backspace key.
  - Ported Arabic diacritic removal software from Haskell to Golang. [See ported project in Golang](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/remove-arabic-diacritics-by-golang)
- March 4th: deployed Type and Replace v1.22 to Online Utilities page. Added support for Pinyin, Polish, Latin, Scottish Gaelic, Irish Gaelic, Buckwalter transliteration system for Arabic, Soqotri and Mehri.
- Created a suite of single page web applications that I called "Type and Replace" for typing languages such as French, and Portuguese which require charcters with diacritics such as the cedilla and acute accent. Unlike the previous virtual keyboard layouts which are designed for people who are already familiar with how to type in that language, this solution does not emulate a keyboard layout. Instead it provides combinations of characters that when typed are replaced with the desired character. For example an "h" character then an apostrophe may be replaced with an h with a diacritic. Try the app using French at https://elsanussi-s-mneina.github.io/u/frenchQuickTypist.html . [see repository](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/type-and-replace-html-js). Other supported orthographyies are Spanish, Portuguese, Maltese, Berber Latin Alphabet, and ISO233 Arabic Romanization.

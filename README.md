# Repository News
## March 2021
- Created a suite of single page web applications that I called "Type and Replace" for typing languages such as French, and Portuguese which require charcters with diacritics such as the cedilla and acute accent. Unlike the previous virtual keyboard layouts which are designed for people who are already familiar with how to type in that language, this solution does not emulate a keyboard layout. Instead it provides combinations of characters that when typed are replaced with the desired character. For example an "h" character then an apostrophe may be replaced with an h with a diacritic. Try the app using French at https://elsanussi-s-mneina.github.io/u/frenchQuickTypist.html . [see repository](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/type-and-replace-html-js). Other supported orthographyies are Spanish, Portuguese, Maltese, Berber Latin Alphabet, and ISO233 Arabic Romanization.
- March 4th: deployed Type and Replace v1.22 to Online Utilities page. Added support for Pinyin, Polish, Latin, Scottish Gaelic, Irish Gaelic, Buckwalter transliteration system for Arabic, Soqotri and Mehri.
## February 2021
- Create a Portfolio page listing relevant projects in a readable order with links to source code, and web applications.
- Created an Arabic Virtual Keyboard ([try it](https://elsanussi-s-mneina.github.io/u/ar_pc_virt.html), [see repo](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/arabic_pc_virtual_keyboard_in_html_javascript)) (A single page web application for typing Arabic using the Arabic (PC) keyboard layout)

## January 2021
- Created a single page web application to type Arabic in Arabic script using only ASCII characters as an input method (or vice versa) called [one-apostrophe arabic transliteration...](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/one-apostrophe-arabic-transliteration-html-js)

## December 2020 
The month was mostly spent on creating useful Dvorak keyboard layouts, creating example keyboard layouts for others to learn from, and a few experimental keyboard layouts for typing Arabic script, and for typing Arabic romanization.
- Created [IPA-keyboard-modifications repository](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/IPA-keyboard-modifications), so I can type International Phonetic Alphabets using Dvorak keyboard layout.
- Created [keyboard-layout-translation repository](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/keyboard-layout-translation), so I can convert a Macintosh QWERTY keyboard layout to Dvorak by running a script.
- Created example keyboard layouts for those who want to understand the file format for specifying keyboard layouts on Windows and Mac:
-- Created [qwerty-keyboard-layout-template-windows](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/qwerty-keyboard-layout-template-windows)
-- Created [dvorak-keyboard-layout-template-macos-catalina](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/dvorak-keyboard-layout-template-macos-catalina)
-- Created [colemak-keyboard-layout-template-macos-catalina](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/colemak-keyboard-layout-template-macos-catalina)
-- Created [qwerty-keyboard-layout-template-macos-catalina](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/qwerty-keyboard-layout-template-macos-catalina)

- Created [dvorak-arabic-input-via-latin-digraphs](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/dvorak-arabic-input-via-latin-digraphs) a way to input Arabic characters via typing Latin letter digraphs, e.g. gh -> Øº. I don't use it, but it was an interestinng experiment using dead-keys.
- Done working on [dvorak-arabic-romanization-keyboard-layout-for-macos-catalina](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/dvorak-arabic-romanization-keyboard-layout-for-macos-catalina), which is for writing the characters required by standardized Arabic romanization systems.

## November 2020
- added new [diagnostic keyboard layout](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/keycodes-for-keyboard-macos-catalina-diagnostics) for MacOS Catalina, and a screenshot of the keycodes

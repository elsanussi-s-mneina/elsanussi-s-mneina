# Welcome
This GitHub profile contains the personal programming projects started by Elsanussi Mneina.

A few of the public projects here are desktop applications. Some are console applications, and one is a web application.
A few projects are custom keyboard layouts I made, or small examples showing how to do something in a programming language.

The following is a list of projects for prospective employers to look at.
